	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

	<p>I want to become a developer because I enjoy solving problems and creating things using technology. Development allows me to turn ideas into real applications that people can use in their daily lives. I like how coding challenges my thinking, improves my logic, and constantly pushes me to learn new skills.</p>
